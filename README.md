Adding an image of the website is a great idea to give visitors a visual sneak peek! The best spot would be right after the "Demo" section, where users are already primed to see how the app works. This placement keeps the flow intuitive: they read about the demo, then see it in action with a screenshot.

Here’s the updated README with the suggested spot marked as `#$image`:

# Chicken Disease Classification Using Fecal Image 🐔💩

Welcome to **Chicken Disease Classification Using Fecal Image**, a quirky yet powerful AI tool to diagnose chicken health through their droppings! Built with a fine-tuned VGG16 model, this project detects **Coccidiosis** or confirms a healthy cluck with a stellar **98% accuracy**. Upload a poop pic, and let our "Poop-o-tron 3000" deliver insights with a dash of chicken humor! 🎉

---

## ✨ Features

- **Poop Pic Diagnosis**: Upload an image of chicken droppings for instant health insights.
- **High Accuracy**: 98% accurate predictions using a fine-tuned VGG16 model.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A responsive, playful web app built with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- **Pipeline Perfection**: Structured workflow from data ingestion to model prediction.
- **Chicken Jokes**: Because poop-checking deserves a laugh!
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Includes a halted CI/CD setup (AWS details pending)—a pilot for mastering pipelining.

## 🐔 What’s Coccidiosis?

Coccidiosis is a pesky parasitic disease caused by *Eimeria* protozoa that messes with a chicken’s gut. It’s a common coop culprit, especially in crowded or soggy conditions. Here’s the lowdown:

- **Symptoms**: Bloody or watery poop, droopy wings, ruffled feathers, and a gloomy cluck.
- **Impact**: Stunts growth, cuts egg production, and can send chickens to the big henhouse in the sky if ignored.
- **Why It Matters**: Early detection saves flocks—and farmer wallets! Our tool spots it fast so you can act quicker than a rooster at dawn.

## 🚀 How It Works

This project follows a clean **pipeline structure** to turn poop pics into health diagnoses:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Users upload chicken poop images via the web interface.  
   - Images are processed and prepped for the model.

2. **Model Training**  
   - Built on the **VGG16** convolutional base (pre-trained on ImageNet).  
   - Fine-tuned fully connected layers to classify poop as "Healthy" or "Coccidiosis".  
   - Trained on a curated dataset of chicken droppings (yes, we dug into the coop!).

3. **Evaluation & Prediction**  
   - User-uploaded images are fed into the model.  
   - Outputs a diagnosis with a confidence score—served with a chuckle-worthy twist.

4. **Pipeline Structure**  
   - Modular code ensures smooth flow: ingestion → preprocessing → prediction → display.  
   - Easy to maintain, extend, or debug!

5. **CI/CD Pipeline (Pilot)**  
   - Features a CI/CD setup for automated testing and deployment—currently paused due to missing AWS credentials.  
   - A learning sandbox to master pipelining from scratch!

6. **Accuracy**  
   - Achieves a whopping **98% accuracy** on test data, making it a trusty coop companion.

## 📸 Demo

1. Visit the web app.
2. Click "Drop the Poop!" to upload an image.
3. Hit "Sniff It Out!" to get a diagnosis.
4. Giggle at the chicken joke while you wait!

**Sample Output**:  
- Healthy: "🐔 Healthy 🐔 - Cluck-tastic! This poop’s golden!"  
- Coccidiosis: "🐔 Coccidiosis 🐔 - Emergency cluck! Spa day needed!"

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Node.js (optional, for local hosting)
- A passion for poultry (non-negotiable 🐔)

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HardikChhallani/Chicken-Disease-Classification-Using-Fecal-Image.git
   cd Chicken-Disease-Classification-Using-Fecal-Image
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Chickens are the backbone of farms and backyards. Coccidiosis can wipe out flocks, costing time, money, and feathered pals. With **Chicken Disease Classification Using Fecal Image**, we’re giving chicken keepers a fast, funny way to keep their coops thriving—one poop at a time.

### How to Use the Image Spot:
- Replace `#$image` with an actual image link once you have a screenshot. For example:
  ```markdown
  ![Website Screenshot](path/to/screenshot.png)
  ```
- Upload the screenshot to your GitHub repo (e.g., in an `images` folder) and link it like:
  ```markdown
  ![Website Screenshot](images/screenshot.png)
  ```

This placement keeps the README flowing naturally—demo instructions followed by a visual, then setup details. Let me know if you’d prefer the image elsewhere! 🐔📸
